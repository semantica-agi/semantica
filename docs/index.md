Perfect for **high-stakes domains** where mistakes have real consequences.

---

### ⚡ Get Started in 30 Seconds

```bash
pip install semantica
```

```python
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor

## 🚨 The Problem: The Semantic Gap

### Most AI systems fail in high-stakes domains because they operate on **text similarity**, not **meaning**.

### Understanding the Semantic Gap

The **semantic gap** is the fundamental disconnect between what AI systems can process (text patterns, vector similarities) and what high-stakes applications require (semantic understanding, meaning, context, and relationships).

**Traditional AI approaches:**
- Rely on statistical patterns and text similarity
- Cannot understand relationships between entities
- Cannot reason about domain-specific rules
- Cannot explain why decisions were made
- Cannot trace back to original sources with confidence

**High-stakes AI requires:**
- Semantic understanding of entities and their relationships
- Domain knowledge encoded as formal rules (ontologies)
- Explainable reasoning paths
- Source-level provenance
- Conflict detection and resolution

**Semantica bridges this gap** by providing a semantic intelligence layer that transforms unstructured data into validated, explainable, and auditable knowledge.

### What Organizations Have vs What They Need

| **Current State** | **Required for High-Stakes AI** |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| PDFs, DOCX, emails, logs | Formal domain rules (ontologies) |
| APIs, databases, streams | Structured and validated entities |
| Conflicting facts and duplicates | Explicit semantic relationships |
| Siloed systems with no lineage | **Explainable reasoning paths** |
| | **Source-level provenance** |
| | **Audit-ready compliance** |

### The Cost of Missing Semantics

- **Decisions cannot be explained** — No transparency in AI reasoning
- **Errors cannot be traced** — No way to debug or improve
- **Conflicts go undetected** — Contradictory information causes failures
- **Compliance becomes impossible** — No audit trails for regulations

**Trustworthy AI requires semantic accountability.**

## 🆚 Semantica vs Traditional RAG

| Feature | Traditional RAG | Semantica |
|:--------|:----------------|:----------|
| **Reasoning** | ❌ Black-box answers | ✅ Explainable reasoning paths |
| **Provenance** | ❌ No provenance | ✅ W3C PROV-O compliant lineage tracking |
| **Search** | ⚠️ Vector similarity only | ✅ Semantic + graph reasoning |
| **Quality** | ❌ No conflict handling | ✅ Explicit contradiction detection |
| **Safety** | ⚠️ Unsafe for high-stakes | ✅ Designed for governed environments |
| **Compliance** | ❌ No audit trails | ✅ Complete audit trails with integrity verification |

## 🚦 Quick Example

Semantica uses a modular architecture. You can use individual modules directly for maximum flexibility:

```python
from semantica.ingest import FileIngestor
from semantica.parse import DocumentParser
from semantica.semantic_extract import NERExtractor, RelationExtractor
from semantica.kg import GraphBuilder

# 1. Ingest documents
ingestor = FileIngestor()
documents = ingestor.ingest_directory("documents/", recursive=True)

# 2. Parse documents
parser = DocumentParser()
parsed_docs = [parser.parse_document(doc) for doc in documents]

# 3. Extract entities and relationships
ner = NERExtractor()
rel_extractor = RelationExtractor()

entities = []
relationships = []
for doc in parsed_docs:
    text = doc.get("full_text", "")
    doc_entities = ner.extract_entities(text)
    doc_rels = rel_extractor.extract_relations(text, entities=doc_entities)
    entities.extend(doc_entities)
    relationships.extend(doc_rels)

# 4. Build knowledge graph
builder = GraphBuilder(merge_entities=True)
kg = builder.build_graph(entities=entities, relationships=relationships)

print(f"Created graph with {len(kg.nodes)} nodes and {len(kg.edges)} edges")
```

!!! tip "Orchestration Option"
    For complex workflows, you can also use the `Semantica` class for orchestration. See the [Core Module](reference/core.md) documentation for details.
